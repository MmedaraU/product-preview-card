### My experience

I finally got to attempt my second Frontend Mentor challenge and it's great to see that the time I've spent learning has actually paid off.

I spent far less time building this than the *QR Code Component Challenge* and I could actually remember a lot more this time. I barely had to look at my notes. I'm making progress. Baby steps, but I like it.

I am back in school but not so caught up with school work yet that it's a struggle. Hopefully, I can keep up the pace this time. I've spent the time between projects developing a learning plan and actually implementing it. Seems it's working even with my school schedule.

I've been making notes on all I've been learning. All I've learnt so far is in the `cheatsheets` repo on my profile. I'm committing this year to building consistently so I don't get stuck in a rut like last time.

This project is really similar to the *QR component challenge*. I started with the HTML for structure before diving into CSS. I always start with the desktop view just because it's easier for me.

I hope to do something else soon, depends on how school work piles on.

### Continued development
For the next challenge I work on, I want to do something with CSS Grid to really get to see how it works because what I have right now is mostly theoretical knowledge and it's been a while since I've done anything with Grid.

### Useful resources

This time around, when I got stuck, I referred to the code on the QR code component challenge and my notes in the `cheatsheets` repository. I honestly don't think that's the best name for that repo 'cause they're not really `cheatsheets`, they're really just notes.
